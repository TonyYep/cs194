# CS194 Project Code - Synthetic Image Dataset Generation via AutoGen
We provide two strategies via AutoGen - [MixUp](Mixup/) and [Inpainting](AutoGenInpainting/). 


## Evaluation Part:
We train Resnet 18 for image classification and Image detection tasks on both unaugmented dataset and LLM=based augment dataset to see if our generated dataset is valid.
